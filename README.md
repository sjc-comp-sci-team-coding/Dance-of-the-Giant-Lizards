## How to Run

- Install the latest version of python 3.
- Ensure your command line interface (CLI) is in the root directory of the repo.
  - You should see `main.py` within the current directory of your CLI.
- Run the following command in your CLI: `python3 main.py` and follow in game prompts.
  - If your installation of Python is aliased differently from `python3` then call the alias with `main.py` as the argument instead.
